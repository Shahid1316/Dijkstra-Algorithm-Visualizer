1. Introduction
 The Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer is an educational tool designed to help
 users understand graph theory concepts through interactive
 visualization and algorithm demonstration. Users can create their own
 graphs, visualize Dijkstra's algorithm, and explore the relationships
 between nodes and edges.
 2. Objectives
 ○ Toprovide an interactive interface for users to create and
 visualize graphs.
 ○ Todemonstrate Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path
 between two nodes.
 ○ Toenhance understanding of fundamental graph theory concepts
 through hands-on experience.
 3. Features
 Core Features
 ○ GraphCreation: Users can add nodes and edges with specified
 weights to create graphs.
 ○ Interactive Visualization: The platform visualizes the current
 graph with labeled nodes and edges.
 ○ Dijkstra's Algorithm: Users can input a source and target node,
 and the platform will compute and display the shortest path and
 its length.
 ○ Real-time Updates: The graph visualization updates dynamically
 as users add nodes and edges.
 4. Enhanced Features
 ○ GraphLayout Optimization: Improved algorithms for node
 positioning to minimize edge intersections and enhance clarity.
 ○ User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive GUI designed
 using Tkinter and Matplotlib.
 ○ Robust Data Input Handling: Validations for node and edge
 inputs to ensure accurate graph representation.
 5. Implementation
 The Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer is built using Python with the following
 libraries:
 ○ Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
 ○ Matplotlib: For visualizing the graph.
 ○ NetworkX: For managing graph structures and algorithms.
 6. Code Structure
 The code is structured into a main class (GraphLearningPlatform)
 that handles:
○ Initialization of the GUI components.
 ○ Methods for adding nodes and edges to the graph.
 ○ Visualization of the graph using Matplotlib.
 ○ Execution of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
 7. Testing
 The platform was tested for various use cases, including:
 ○ Adding multiple nodes and edges.
 ○ Running Dijkstra’s algorithm with valid and invalid inputs.
 ○ Visualizing complex graphs to ensure clarity and correct
 representation.
 8. Challenges Faced
 ○ Ensuring nodes and edges were visually distinct and easy to
 read, particularly in dense graphs.
 ○ Implementing an intuitive user interface that facilitated ease of
 use for users unfamiliar with graph theory.
 9. Future Enhancements
 ○ Extended Algorithms: Implement additional graph algorithms
 (e.g., A*, Bellman-Ford) for broader educational scope.
 ○ GraphExport/Import: Allow users to save and load graphs for
 continued exploration.
 ○ Customizable Node and Edge Properties: Enable users to
 customize node colors, sizes, and edge styles for better visual
 representation.
 ○ Interactive Tutorials: Provide guided tutorials within the platform
 to help users learn graph theory concepts step by step.
 10. Conclusion
 The Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer successfully serves as an educational
 tool for visualizing and understanding graph theory concepts. Its
 interactive features and user-friendly design make it a valuable resource
 for students and enthusiasts alike. Future enhancements will further
 improve its educational value and usability.
